      This page is dedicated to tell the story of how it all began and how the construction of FlashScreener progressed.
    </p>

    <h3>GENESIS</h3>
    <p>
      It all started in 2024, with peak activity in the trenches. Mfers in their underwear made more money 
      from a laptop in their bedrooms than judges and doctors working the entire month. Dozens, hundreds, thousands of CAs 
      on the timeline per day. Anyone would go crazy with the numbers.
    </p>

    <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
    <p>
      It turns out that this, while profitable in many cases, proved to be somewhat tedious at certain points. And this is 
      a big problem when we're talking about an environment where seconds make a difference. Having to open and check dozens 
      of CAs per day and analyze the vital points of each one is a tedious task. And I myself couldn't take it anymore. 
      Someone would send me the CA of a token on Twitter/X, and I'd have to copy, paste into a new tab, and redo the process 
      on a new website because the one I was on before didn't have the information I wanted. In short, annoying.
    </p>

    <h3>THE IDEA</h3>
    <p>
      Then I had an idea. What if there was a tool that wasn't necessarily automatic and analyzed everything for me, but at 
      least cut out the hassle of having to open the sites for each CA? So I sent a message in the pump.fun support group on 
      Telegram, which was full of degens at that time. And then I asked if there was a tool that could do this kind of thing. The 
      people there didn't quite understand what I meant, and I couldn't quite express what I was envisioning; the idea was too 
      fresh, and I couldn't organize myself to explain it to others.
    </p>

    <h3>WHAT IF?</h3>
    <p>
      What if I made this tool myself? I saw the possibilities, if it was feasible to develop such a thing. I had this idea in my 
      head for weeks until I took the first steps. At that time, it was just a personal tool, which I was making for myself, maybe a few
      friends who wanted to use it, but the extension was something especially made for me to fix the boredom of opening thousand CAs.
    </p>

    <h3>IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
    <p>
      I wrote the first draft of the code to simply open CAs on PumpFun. At the time, the temporary title I gave this tool was 
      "check.fun," since it was a tool that, in a sense, checked CAs. I sometimes called it shortcutfun. It was the prototypes that 
      would become the final version, FlashScreener. Although I had the idea much earlier, I decided to take action by the first weeks
      of 2025. On January 23 I posted the first update on X. On January 26, I submitted the project and paid the submission fee to Google.
      That was the beginning of something big.
    </p>

    <h3>EVOLUTION</h3>
    <p>
      As time went by, some close friends and I always used the extension. In fact, the feature to open CA in Photon was a specific 
      request from a friend. Talking to these friends, they always showed me a lot of enthusiasm and praised how it helped them 
      and that they couldn't live without the extension in their daily trenching anymore. This got me thinking: I'm a big fan of my tool; my
      friends really enjoy it. Would more people like to enjoy this experience too? That's when I decided to tokenize the project.
    </p>

    <h3>TOKENIZATION</h3>
    <p>
      Many people have asked me: Why tokenize a product that's free and anyone can use? Why would anyone buy the coin? My answer is quite 
      simple. Currently, what drives trenches and motivates the masses to buy tokens, whether memes or utility tokens, is the possibility 
      of making a profit and being part of something great. This doesn't mean that $FLASH is an investment with promised profits; on the 
      contrary, it's a token like any other memecoin; the community and culture are what make the project successful. A super-hyped 
      meme without community and leadership is nothing more than an empty and artificial pump; and a token with unique utility and 
      cutting-edge leadership, but without community and culture, is nothing more than a flop. So why not combine the best of both and see what happens? 
      $FLASH is where the degenerate and unemployed world of trenches meets the utility and tek of a serious project. Free and open to everyone, 
      where everybody has the same chances and opportunities, and I will do my best to take our community to the highest levels ever seen by a 
      token created on pump fun. Because this isn't just about FlashScreener, this is about our culture.
    </p>

        <h3>WHAT'S $FLASH?</h3>
    <p>
      $FLASH is an extension of FlashScreener. And FlashScreener is my main and only project that I started to develop/idealize in 2024. It wasn't created
      today just for the lols or to pump my bags. Utility and perks are in most cases bullshit, just an escuse for devs who promise and never deliver, 
      just thinking about pumping their own bags. $FLASH is a token just like $TROLL, $FARTCOIN, $SPX6900... community and intrinsic value are the key.
      I will be here working and improving my project as much as I can 24/7 because I love and believe in it, and that's why I'm buying $FLASH, cuz if 
      I'm right, it will go much higher. I didn't launch the token to be the foundation and build the tool on top of it. I first built the utility, and 
      months later the token came. The token follows the utility, the tool/extension is the utility, not the other way around. Good tek/community = good price.
    </p>

          <h3>HOW IT WAS DEPLOYED?</h3>
    <p>
      When I deployed $FLASH, I reserved only 69 coins for me, the dev. I didn't take 2% or 5% for the "team and marketing" like all the other projects. All the 
      supply I have is being acquired with the fees generated (buybacks). ALL the supply was put on the open market so that EVERYONE had the same opportunity, 
      including me. This alone already demonstrates a distinct difference in the direction $FLASH will take. There are no benefits other than a single mission: 
      to make FlashScreener reach levels never seen before for a token/project created on pump fun. I could have gone ahead without ever tokenizing this product, 
      and it would still serve the same purpose. But the difference now is that we're doing this TOGETHER, and if I'm right, many will be unimaginably rewarded 
      along the way.
    </p>

            <h3>UTILITY</h3>
    <p>
      People ask me about the token utility. Why should every token have a utility? And why do most tokens with "utility" flop? Because utility is often non-existent, 
      and devs try to force a false promise down holder's throats that those tokens are a good investment by inventing unnecessary utilities and tokenomics. The utility 
      of $FLASH isn't in the token itself, it's in its tool, in the ability to open a CA in less than 2 seconds and perform a trade faster/efficient than 90% of CT. 
      $FLASH is for users that believe this is a useful tool that has potential to expand exponentially to millions of new users, just as I do.
      Ask yourself: Is it useful? Would more people like to use it?
      If you answered yes to both questions, then the calculation is simple: (more users = more holders = more value)=utility
    </p>

      <h3>SO IS $FLASH A MEME?</h3>
    <p>
      I wouldn't say it's a meme but yea! Meme type cult communities are the strongest ones, even stronger than utility communities
      utility holders hold the token as long as the token does its ""utility"" job, if it doesn't, everyone is out. On the other hand, meme type cults 
      hold because they believe in it and they love it. Profits are a consequence, not a reward for the "utility". I already gave you the utility for free🤲
      now we build the cult around the lighthouse of the trenches, $FLASH is the CA that can see every other CA. Solana mass adoption is inevitable,
      and we will light the way for them.
    </p>

        <h3>FINAL TAKE</h3>
    <p>
      Solana's growth is inevitable, and so is Pumpfun's growth. Multiple tokens are being created every minute, thousands and thousands of brand new CAs. 
      You can try to hit the right CA and win big. It's entirely possible! But what are the odds? if it was easy, everyone would have retired by now. 
      NEVER STOP CLICKING THO! But, instead of the infinite loop of trying to hit one single CA among millions, why not own a token that has power over all 
      the other CAs and exponential mass adoption potential? Solana/Pumpfun growing = more tokens = more CAs = more demand = too many people for too little supply.
      FlashScreener tek is simple and easy. Be careful not to confuse simple and easy with dumb and lazy. The masses are coming to Solana because it's efficient, 
      user-friendly, anyone can use it and it's cheap. (just like pump fun)
      FlashScreener works, it's easy and it's FREE + full built from/to the trenches. We are building culture and power, not just hype and noise.
      $FLASH
